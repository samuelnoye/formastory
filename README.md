# formastory
Forms are great for collecting information on users, like job applications or insightful surveys. However, we can also stretch our creative muscles and have a little fun with forms. For this project, weâ€™ll use our knowledge of the HTML &lt;form> and grab user input to put a spin on a classic story!
